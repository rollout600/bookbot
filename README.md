# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot is intended to give you a word count of the given book, and a count of how many times the various letters appear in the text

when calling on BookBot please use the following format

python3 main.py <path to book>

Any letters not listed in the BookBot output should be considered absent from the text

BookBot is currently compatible with books written with the latin, greek and hebrew alphabets

Further updates will add more languages
